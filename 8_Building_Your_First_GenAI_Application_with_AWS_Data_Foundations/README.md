# 8. Building Your First GenAI Application with AWS Data Foundations

Enter the world of Generative AI with practical, industry-focused applications. This section guides you through building two complete GenAI solutions: a financial claims processing agent and a healthcare clinical notes system. You'll learn how to implement RAG using pgvector as your knowledge store, integrate with popular LLM models, and build production-ready AI applications.

No more struggling with complex vector storage, knowledge retrieval, or agentic workflow â€“ we'll show you how AWS makes it simple.

Ready to harness the power of Generative AI? Welcome to your journey of building production-ready GenAI applications! ðŸš€

In this section, you'll:

- Build two complete industry-focused GenAI solutions
- Master RAG implementation using Amazon Bedrock and Aurora pgvector for efficient knowledge retrieval
- Implement semantic search and vector storage at scale
- Create intelligent agents using Amazon Bedrock Agents for complex workflows
- Optimize RAG costs while maintaining high performance and scalability

We'll demystify how to unlock the value of your organizational data through GenAI applications. You'll learn how AWS purpose-built databases work together to not just store data, but to transform it into actionable insights and intelligent experiences. By the end, you'll have working solutions for both financial services and healthcare use cases that demonstrate how to turn your data into a strategic asset - whether it's automating claims processing or extracting insights from clinical notes.

Let's dive in and transform the way you build AI applications! ðŸ’ª
