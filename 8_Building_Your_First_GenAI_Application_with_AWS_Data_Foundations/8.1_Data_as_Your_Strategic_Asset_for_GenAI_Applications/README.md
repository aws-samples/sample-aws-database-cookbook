## The State of GenAI Adoption and Database Integration

Studies reveal critical insights about GenAI implementation and success factors. [Deloitte's "State of Generative AI in the Enterprise 2024 Q3 Report"](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/articles/state-of-generative-ai-in-enterprise.html) found that across 2,770 organizations, **only 26% of GenAI experiments have moved to production**, highlighting a significant gap between experimentation and deployment. Internal AWS studies demonstrate that organizations achieve **substantially 70% increase in success rates when implementing GenAI with robust database foundations**. These findings underscore that successful GenAI implementations require both practical, production-ready approaches and strong data infrastructure.

## Building a Modern Cloud-Based Application

Let's explore how to implement a GenAI-powered application like CosmoInsurance, focusing on providing personalized auto insurance quotes.

![CosmoInsurance Architecture](images/8.1-cosmo-insurance-architecture.png)

**Key components:**

- **Search functionality ([Amazon OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/))**: Enables fast, accurate retrieval of relevant insurance information and policies.
- **Customer profiles ([Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)/[Amazon DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/))**: Stores and manages customer data with high performance and scalability.
- **AI-powered assistant ([Vector database](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/vector-databases/))**: Facilitates semantic search and intelligent query processing for personalized interactions.
- **Billing processing ([Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/RDS(https://aws.amazon.com/rds/))**: Handles transactional data with strong consistency and ACID compliance.
- **Recommendations ([Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/))**: Leverages graph relationships for personalized insurance product suggestions.

## Data Sources and Challenges

### Where Does Your Data Live?

![CosmoInsurance Data](images/8.1-cosmo-data-sources.png)

Your organizational knowledge exists in many forms:

- Customer interactions in CRM systems
- Documents and presentations in content management systems
- Transactions in operational databases
- Regulations and policies in knowledge bases
- Real-time data from applications and devices

Organizations face multiple data management hurdles in their GenAI journey. Data silos prevent efficient information sharing across departments, while maintaining data quality and understanding data lineage remains crucial for reliable AI outcomes. Self-managed data stores often struggle with proper PII handling, access control implementation, and identifier resolution across systems, which poses significant challenges that must be addressed for successful GenAI implementations.

## Leveraging AWS Fully Managed Cloud Databases

AWS offers a comprehensive suite of [purpose-built databases](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/) to suit for your exact workload needs:

- Relational: [Amazon Aurora(MySQL, PostgreSQL)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), [Amazon Aurora DSQL - serverless distributed SQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/dsql/)
- Key-Value: [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
- Wide column: [Amazon Keyspaces(for Apache Cassandra)](https://aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/)
- Document (JSON): [Amazon DocumentDB(with MongoDB compatibility)](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/)

> 💡 **Note:** AWS is investing in a zero-ETL future. [Read more to keep up to date for more 0-ETL capabilities](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/zero-etl/).

## Behind the Scenes: GenAI Application Flow

Let's break down a typical interaction:

```plaintext
User: "I'm interested in getting car insurance."
```

![AWS Zero-ETL Integration](images/8.1-data-genai-application-flow.png)

1. **Conversation State/History**: 
   - Service: Amazon ElastiCache / Amazon MemoryDB / Amazon DynamoDB
   - Purpose: Maintain context, and quick retrieval for context beyond what LLM can provide.

2. **Situational Context**: 
   - Service: Amazon DynamoDB / Amazon Aurora / Amazon RDS / Amazon DocumentDB
   - Purpose: Retrieve user data, preferences, and historical interactions to enable personalized and contextually relevant responses. This layer is critical for differentiating your GenAI application - while foundation models provide general intelligence, your organization's data about customer relationships, past interactions, and specific context enables truly personalized experiences that competitors cannot easily replicate.

3. **AI Processing**: 
   - Service: [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
   - Purpose: Natural language understanding

4. **Knowledge Retrieval**: 
   - Service: [Vector database](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/vector-databases/), such as Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL with pgvector, Amazon Neptune
   - Purpose: Access relevant insurance inforamtion, documents, policies, knowledge within the organization

5. **Response Generation**: 
   - Service: Amazon Bedrock
   - Purpose: Create personalized reply

## Implementing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

Your **unstructured**(structured, semi-structured) data sources (e.g. pdfs, images, videos) have to be **vectorized into something called vector embeddings** or numerical representations to be stored either in memory or a persistent storage for the machine learning (ML) models or the large language model (LLM) to understand and respond to your questions.

> 💡 **Note:** You don't have to vectorize your structured/semi-structured data to be able to retrieve by your ML/LL models. Think of: you have an Excel sheet with user orders in the past and pdf documents with insurance policies. You can do a filter by transaction_id column to locate the exact transaction quickly (e.g. select * from user_orders where transaction_id = '123';), while you will do a similarity search using vector embeddings to quickly find the insurance policy documents that semantically relevant to your query.

![Generate Vector Embeddings](images/8.1-rag-vector-embeddings.png)

Building an augmented prompt involves combining multiple elements to create a more effective and contextualized interaction with an AI model. The process begins with user input, which is then enhanced through prompt engineering. This includes adding instructions for the model, such as specifying its role (e.g., as a conversation agent for an insurance marketplace) and defining response parameters. Situational context is incorporated, providing specific details about the user (like Wanchen's location and vehicle information) to personalize the interaction. Semantic context is also added, including relevant domain knowledge (such as information about auto insurance requirements). These components are combined with the user's prompt or question to form an augmented prompt. This enhanced prompt is then submitted to a generative AI model, which uses this rich context to provide more accurate, relevant, and personalized responses.

![Building an augumented prompt](images/8.1-building-augmented-prompt.png)

Looking to manage both situational and semantic contexts efficiently? [Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.AuroraPostgreSQL.html) offers a fully managed database solution that can handle both types of context storage needs. For situational context, it stores user-specific data like historical user transactions, personal information and preferences via OLTP queries ([Performing a proof of concept with Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-poc.html)), while for semantic context, it stores vector embeddings via [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) for domain knowledge and reference materials. When integrated with Amazon Bedrock's embedding models, Aurora PostgreSQL enables vector search capabilities, making it ideal for retrieving relevant context that enhances your AI application's responses.

> 💡 **Note**: Ready to build AI-powered applications? The [Generative AI with Aurora Workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/genai-with-aurora/en-US) shows you how to combine vector databases with large language models. You\'ll build intelligent applications that can understand and generate human-like responses using your own data.

![Basic solution architecture](images/8.1-basic-genai-solution-architecture.png)

## Evolution of RAG Methods

### 1. Basic RAG

Basic RAG represents the simplest implementation of retrieval-augmented generation, offering a straightforward approach to knowledge retrieval. It typically involves direct vector similarity search without sophisticated pre-processing or validation steps. While quick to implement, it may face challenges with complex queries or when high accuracy is required. This approach is best suited for simple question-answering scenarios where the context is clear and direct.

### 2. Advanced RAG

Advanced RAG builds upon the basic implementation by incorporating sophisticated search techniques and validation processes. It combines vector search with keyword-based approaches (hybrid search), implements pre-retrieval filtering to improve relevance, and includes post-retrieval validation to ensure response accuracy. This method often achieves better results through techniques like re-ranking, context summarization, and structured data integration, making it suitable for production environments where accuracy is crucial.

### 3. Agentic RAG

Agentic RAG represents the most sophisticated approach, employing autonomous AI agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex multi-step tasks. Unlike traditional RAG systems that simply retrieve and generate, Agentic RAG uses intelligent agents to dynamically select retrieval strategies, validate information across multiple sources, and perform actions based on retrieved context. These agents can seamlessly switch between different retrieval strategies (vector search, GraphRAG, text-to-SQL), interact with external APIs, and make decisions about when to gather additional information or execute specific tasks. This autonomous capability makes it ideal for complex applications requiring multi-step reasoning, dynamic decision-making, and integration with business processes.

## Advanced RAG Techniques

### Hybrid Search

Combining vector search with keyword-based search for improved accuracy.

### Text-to-SQL

For queries requiring precise aggregations or exact counts, vector search might not be the best approach. These scenarios require 100% recall (retrieving all relevant records without missing any) to ensure accurate calculations. While vector search excels at semantic similarity, it's not designed for exact match or complete set operations.

The workflow involves:

1. User asks a question requiring precise data retrieval.
2. The LLM translates the natural language query into a SQL query.
3. The SQL query is executed against a relational database.
4. Results are formatted and returned to the user.

**100% recall** is crucial for scenarios such as:

- Financial calculations (total spending, average payments)
- Compliance reporting (complete audit trails)
- Inventory management (exact stock counts)
- Transaction history (complete payment records)
- Usage analytics (precise user activity metrics)

Example scenario:

```
User: "What's the total amount I paid for car insurance in the last 3 years?"

LLM generates SQL: 
SELECT 
    YEAR(payment_date) as year,
    SUM(premium_amount) as yearly_total,
    COUNT(payment_id) as payment_count
FROM insurance_payments
WHERE customer_id = 'USER123' 
    AND payment_date >= DATEADD(year, -3, CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY YEAR(payment_date)
ORDER BY year DESC;

Database returns:
2024: $1,200 (12 payments)
2023: $990 (12 payments)
2022: $900 (12 payments)

LLM formats response:
"Over the past three years, you paid:
- 2024: $1,200 (monthly payments of $100)
- 2023: $990 (monthly payments of $82.50)
- 2022: $900 (monthly payments of $75)
Total: $3,090"
```

In these cases, using vector search could lead to incomplete or inaccurate results, as it might miss relevant records or provide approximate matches. Traditional SQL queries ensure every matching record is included in the calculation, providing the exact accuracy required for business-critical operations.

> 💡 **Note: Understanding Precision vs. Recall**
> 
> ```
> Search Result Types:
> TP (True Positive)  = Relevant items that were retrieved
> FP (False Positive) = Irrelevant items that were retrieved
> FN (False Negative) = Relevant items that were not retrieved
> 
> Precision = TP / (TP + FP)  [How many retrieved items are relevant]
> Recall = TP / (TP + FN)     [How many relevant items were retrieved]
> 
> Example Scenarios:
> ┌───────────────┬───────────┬────────┬────────────────────────────┐
> │ Search Type   │ Precision │ Recall │ Best For                   │
> ├───────────────┼───────────┼────────┼────────────────────────────┤
> │ Vector Search │ High      │ Medium │ Semantic similarity        │
> │ SQL Query     │ High      │ 100%   │ Exact counts/aggregations  │
> │ Hybrid Search │ High      │ High   │ Complex mixed queries      │
> └───────────────┴───────────┴────────┴────────────────────────────┘
> 
> When to Use SQL (100% Recall):
> - Financial calculations
> - Regulatory compliance
> - Inventory counts
> - Transaction records
> ```

### GraphRAG

Leveraging graph databases for complex relationship-based queries, GraphRAG excels at finding insights through relationship patterns rather than just semantic similarity. This approach is particularly powerful when the answer requires understanding connections between entities.

**Best fit scenarios**:

- Questions requiring related, not necessarily semantically similar context
- Queries needing traversal of relationships
- Cases where implicit connections matter more than explicit content

Example scenario in insurance:

```
User Context: Wanchen owns a 2010 sedan with an accident record

Graph Analysis:
1. FACT 1: Wanchen owned a 2010 sedan
2. FACT 2: Accident record exists for 2010 sedan
3. FACT 3: John purchased the 2010 sedan in 2022 (prior to accident)

Graph Traversal Results:
- Identifies that Wanchen sold the car before the accident
- Establishes Wanchen as a low-risk customer
- Connects to similar customer profiles with good records
```

This leads to accurate risk assessment despite the presence of an accident in the vehicle's history.

Knowledge Graph Application:
