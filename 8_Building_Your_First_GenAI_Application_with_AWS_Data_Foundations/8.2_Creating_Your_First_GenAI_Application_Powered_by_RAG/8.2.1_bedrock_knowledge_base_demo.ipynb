    "## Benefits of Using Bedrock Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No infrastructure to manage**: Amazon manages the vector database and scaling\n",
    "- **Quick setup**: Create a working RAG application in minutes\n",
    "- **Automatic document processing**: Handles parsing, chunking, and embedding generation\n",
    "- **Seamless integration**: Easy to connect with other AWS services\n",
    "- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Less customization compared to building your own solution\n",
    "- Limited control over chunking strategies\n",
    "- Fixed embedding models\n",
    "- May not be suitable for specialized domains requiring custom processing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've created a basic RAG application using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore more advanced features in the [Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html)\n",
    "2. Learn how to build a custom RAG solution with Aurora PostgreSQL in [8.2.2_aurora_pgvector_rag_application.ipynb](8.2.2_aurora_pgvector_rag_application.ipynb)\n",
    "3. Apply these concepts to build specialized applications like a [Claim Processing Agent](../8.3_Claim_Processing_Agent/README.MD)\n",
