# 6.1 Understanding Aurora Cost Components

Amazon Aurora clusters are available in two pricing modelsâ€”Aurora Standard and Aurora I/O-Optimizedâ€”each designed to cater to different workload patterns and cost-efficiency needs.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Compute | DB Instance Class, Count, or Aurora Capacity Units (ACUs) for Serverless |
| Storage | GBs of database volume used |
| I/O Operations | Read/Write IOPS from/to Aurora storage |
| Backups | Size and retention of automated/manual snapshots |
| Data Transfer | Inter-AZ or inter-region traffic |

## Topics

- [Aurora Standard](#aurora-standard)
- [Aurora I/O-Optimized](#aurora-i/o-optimized)

## Aurora Standard
This is the default configuration and is ideal for workloads with moderate and predictable I/O usage. Costs are broken down into:
â€¢	Compute: Billed based on instance type and usage (On-Demand or Reserved Instances).
â€¢	Storage: Charged on a pay-per-use basis for the storage consumed.
â€¢	I/O: Charged separately on a pay-per-request model, which means the more read/write operations you perform, the higher your costs.
â€¢	Other Features: Additional charges may apply for features like backtracking, global databases, and snapshot exports.

## Aurora I/O-Optimized
This option is better suited for I/O-intensive applications were eliminating variable I/O charges provides more predictable costs.
â€¢	Compute: Billed similarly to the standard model but incurs a 30% premium.
â€¢	Storage: Still pay-per-use but with a 125% cost increase over the standard model.
â€¢	I/O: No additional charges for I/O operationsâ€”read and write requests are included in the compute and storage pricing, making this attractive for high-throughput applications.
â€¢	Other Features: Feature-based costs remain the same as with the standard model.
