# 6.2 Query Optimization techniques

Efficient query execution is critical to maintaining the performance and cost-effectiveness of Amazon Aurora clusters. Poorly written queries can lead to excessive CPU usage, increased I/O operations, and slower application performanceâ€”ultimately driving up costs. Aurora, being MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible, supports a wide range of query tuning strategies to help you optimize workload performance. By leveraging indexing strategies, analyzing query plans, minimizing full table scans, and offloading read workloads to replicas, you can significantly reduce response times and resource consumption. 

This section outlines practical techniques to identify bottlenecks, streamline query execution, and make the most of Auroraâ€™s performance features like the query plan management and Performance Insights.

## Aurora Architectural Improvements

Amazon Aurora introduces several architectural enhancements that significantly boost application performance compared to traditional database engines. One of the key improvements is the reduction in I/O operationsâ€”Aurora avoids the overhead of buffered writes by sending changes directly to a distributed, highly durable storage layer. This results in faster commit operations and reduced latency. Additionally, Aurora employs an advanced caching mechanism that minimizes disk access by efficiently reusing memory for frequently accessed data. The underlying infrastructure is backed by high-performance SSDs, which contribute to exceptional read/write throughput and responsiveness.

## Performance Insights & CloudWatch Database Insights

[Amazon Aurora Performance Insights](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/performance-insights/) is a powerful monitoring tool that helps you visualize and analyze database performance over time. It provides a rich, time-based interface to identify bottlenecks by highlighting the top SQL queries, wait events, database load, and user activity contributing to performance degradation. 

By enabling Performance Insights, you gain access to a continuously sampled and aggregated view of your workload, which can be filtered by dimensions such as SQL ID, wait state, or application. With seven days of free performance history retention, this makes it easier to pinpoint inefficient queries, understand peak load times, and make informed decisions about indexing, query rewriting, or scaling. Performance Insights supports integration with Amazon CloudWatch and can retain historical data for up to two years (with extended retention), making it an invaluable tool for both real-time diagnostics and long-term trend analysis.

Now, Performance Insights is transitioning to [CloudWatch Database Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_DatabaseInsights.html) that enables you monitor the database load (DB Load) for your fleet of Amazon RDS or Aurora instances. By presenting metrics in a single dashboard for all databases in your fleet, Database Insights allows you to monitor your databases simultaneously.

Database Insights has an [Advanced mode and a Standard mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Database-Insights.html#Database-Insights-modes). Standard mode has a rolling 7 days of performance data history for the database load metric, provided for free. Advanced mode in Performance Insights offers comprehensive monitoring capabilities beyond the standard features. It includes detailed analysis of operating system processes, fleet-wide monitoring views, extended SQL analysis with 15-month retention, visualization of per-query statistics, slow query analysis, and integration with CloudWatch Application Signals. Additionally, it provides a consolidated dashboard for all database telemetry and supports on-demand performance analysis for specific time periods.

## Query Plan Management

Amazon Aurora (specifically with PostgreSQL compatibility) supports [Query Plan Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Optimize.overview.html), a feature designed to ensure query performance consistency by stabilizing execution plans. This mechanism introduces a persistent representation of query plansâ€”called plan outlinesâ€”which are used to govern how queries are executed over time. When a SQL statement is executed two or more times, the query planner selects the minimum cost execution plan as usual. If this is the first plan encountered, it is recorded as an Approved Plan. Any subsequent plans that differ are saved as Unapproved Plans. During re-planning, Aurora prioritizes using the lowest-cost Approved Plan. If none of the approved plans are viable, the engine reverts to the optimizerâ€™s default plan. New plans are evaluated offline before promotion, allowing DBAs to validate performance improvements without introducing risk to production workloads. This feature is especially valuable for production environments where stability and predictability of performance are paramount.

### Enabling Query Plan Management

1. **Enable the feature** in your Aurora PostgreSQL cluster parameter group (requires reboot):
   ```
   rds.enable_plan_management = 1
   ```

2. **Create the apg_plan_mgmt extension**
	```
	CREATE EXTENSION apg_plan_mgmt;
	```
3. **Configure plan capture behavior** - Change the `apg_plan_mgmt.capture_plan_baselines` parameter:
   ```
   apg_plan_mgmt.capture_plan_baselines = automatic
   ```
   
   Options:
   - `automatic`: Captures plans automatically for repeated queries
   - `manual`: Only captures plans when explicitly requested
   - `off`: Disables plan baseline capture
