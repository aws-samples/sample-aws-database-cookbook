## What You'll Learn in This Section

This module breaks down Aurora performance and cost optimization into practical, implementation-focused components:

### [6.1 Understanding Aurora Costs](./6.1_Understanding_Aurora_Costs/README.md)
Master Aurora cost analysis by gaining visibility into cost drivers across compute, storage, I/O, and backup dimensions, and learn to apply targeted savings strategies using Reserved Instances, Graviton processors, and Aurora Serverless for optimal cost management.

### [6.2 Performance Tuning Strategies](./6.2_Performance_Tuning_Strategies/README.md)
Implement advanced performance optimization techniques including query optimization, resource-intensive query identification, proper indexing strategies, and Aurora-specific features like Optimized Reads to maximize database efficiency and reduce resource consumption.

### [6.3 Optimizing Cost Efficiency](./6.3_Optimizing_Cost_Efficiency/README.md)
Deploy comprehensive cost optimization strategies using Aurora's auto-scaling capabilities, automated cluster management for dev/test environments, storage optimization techniques, and intelligent backup retention policies to align costs with business requirements.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Want to slash your database costs? [Aurora I/O-Optimized](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.StorageReliability.html#aurora-storage-type) can reduce costs by up to 40% for I/O-intensive workloads. You pay a predictable price for compute and storage, eliminating surprise I/O charges that can spike your bill.

## Next Steps
