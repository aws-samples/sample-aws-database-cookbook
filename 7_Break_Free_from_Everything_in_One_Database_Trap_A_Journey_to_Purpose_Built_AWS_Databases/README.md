# 7. Break Free from Everything in One Database Trap: A Journey to Purpose-Built AWS Databases

In the world of software development, we frequently encounter a common antipattern: using relational databases as a universal solution for all data storage needs. While relational databases like PostgreSQL are powerful and versatile, they're increasingly being misused as a catch-all solution for storing non-relational data types such as:

- Images
- Raw files 
- JSON documents
- XML
- Other complex data structures

This approach might seem convenient initially, especially when dealing with small datasets or simple queries, as it allows developers to work within familiar territory, maintain a single database system, and leverage existing infrastructure. However, this "one-size-fits-all" approach often reveals its limitations as applications scale and data volumes grow.

Ready to transform your database architecture from a monolithic bottleneck into a purpose-built powerhouse? In this hands-on section, we'll explore how to break free from the "everything in one database" antipattern and leverage AWS's purpose-built databases to optimize performance, reduce costs, and future-proof your applications.

Whether you're dealing with performance issues from storing JSON in PostgreSQL or planning a strategic migration to purpose-built databases, the techniques you'll learn here will revolutionize your data architecture approach.

- Experience with migration strategies and performance optimization
- Best practices for designing scalable, cost-effective database architectures

## What You'll Learn in This Section

This module breaks down purpose-built database selection and migration into practical, implementation-focused components:

### [7.1 Choosing Purpose-Built Databases](./7.1_Choosing-purpose-built-database-aws-detailed/README.md)
Master the art of database selection by understanding AWS purpose-built database offerings, decision frameworks, and mapping workload characteristics to optimal database types while considering cost and operational factors.

### [7.2 Understanding the JSON in RDBMS Antipattern](./7.2_Understanding-the-JSON-in-RDBMS-Antipattern/README.md)
Identify and resolve common JSON storage antipatterns in relational databases, understand performance implications, and learn practical migration paths to document databases with real-world examples and measurements.

### [7.3 Migration Strategies](./7.3_Migration-Strategies/README.md)
Implement comprehensive migration approaches from monolithic to purpose-built databases, including data migration patterns, schema conversions, application changes, and testing strategies for seamless transitions.

### [7.4 Performance Tuning Best Practices](./7.4_Performance-tuning-best-practices/README.md)
Optimize database performance with service-specific techniques, advanced monitoring and diagnostics, query optimization strategies, and resource utilization best practices for each AWS database type.

### [7.5 Future-Proofing Your Database Architecture](./7.5_Scale_for_Future/README.md)
Design scalable and flexible database architectures using multi-model considerations, hybrid approaches, and evolution paths that grow with your applications and business requirements.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Confused about which database to choose? The [Purpose-Built Databases Workshop](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/decision-guides/latest/databases-on-aws-how-to-choose/databases-on-aws-how-to-choose.html) provides a decision framework used by AWS architects. From [Purpose-built databases tutorials](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/learn/), you\'ll learn to match workload characteristics to optimal database engines, avoiding costly architectural mistakes.

## Next Steps
