# Future-Proofing Purpose-Built Databases (DocumentDB, DynamoDB, Keyspaces, Timestream, Neptune)

When building applications on AWS purpose-built databases, planning ahead for scalability, high availability, and evolving needs is critical. Here are strategies tailored for each service:

## 1. Use Read Replicas and Clusters (DocumentDB)

- **Service**: Amazon DocumentDB
- **What to Do**:
  - Add **up to 15 read replicas** to handle read-heavy workloads.
  - Deploy a **multi-instance cluster** to ensure high availability and automatic failover.
- **Why**: Seamlessly scale reads and improve fault tolerance without impacting write throughput.

## 2. Enable Global Tables (DynamoDB)

- **Service**: Amazon DynamoDB
- **What to Do**:
  - Set up **Global Tables** to replicate data across multiple AWS Regions.
- **Why**: Achieve multi-region active-active writes, low-latency access, and automatic disaster recovery.

## 3. Use Auto-Scaling and Adaptive Capacity (DynamoDB)

- **Service**: Amazon DynamoDB
- **What to Do**:
  - Enable **Auto Scaling** to adjust read/write capacity units automatically.
  - Rely on **adaptive capacity** to handle uneven traffic without manual intervention.
- **Why**: Handle sudden workload spikes and maintain performance predictably.


## 4. Design for Horizontal Scaling (Keyspaces)

- **Service**: Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)
- **What to Do**:
  - Design with a **good partition key** to ensure even data distribution.
  - Tune **throughput capacity** for expected workload patterns.
- **Why**: Achieve predictable performance and avoid hotspots as data grows.

## 5. Optimize Data Retention and Query Efficiency (Timestream)

- **Service**: Amazon Timestream
- **What to Do**:
  - Use **magnetic storage** for long-term historical data.
  - Define **tiered retention policies** for memory and magnetic storage.
  - Optimize queries using **time-based filters**.
- **Why**: Efficiently store and query massive volumes of time series data while controlling costs.


## 6. Design Flexible Graph Models (Neptune)

- **Service**: Amazon Neptune
- **What to Do**:
  - Model graphs with future query patterns in mind (property graphs or RDF triples).
  - Use **Neptune Streams** for change data capture (CDC) if integrating with downstream services.
  - Consider **read replicas** for scaling query workloads.
- **Why**: Ensure your graph database can evolve and scale as relationships grow and queries become more complex.


# Final Tips

- Monitor key performance metrics using **CloudWatch** across all services.
- Enable **backups** and **point-in-time recovery** where applicable.
- Test scaling strategies under load early in the development lifecycle.

> ðŸ“š **Pro Tip**: Choose the right database for the right workload and revisit design decisions as your application evolves.
