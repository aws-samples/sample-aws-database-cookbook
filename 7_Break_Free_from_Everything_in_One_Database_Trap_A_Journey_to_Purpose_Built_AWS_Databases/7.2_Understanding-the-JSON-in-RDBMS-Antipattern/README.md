# Understanding the JSON in RDBMS Anti-Pattern

## The Common Scenario
Many organizations start their journey by storing JSON documents in PostgreSQL tables, leveraging PostgreSQL's JSON data types. This approach seems convenient initially, offering:
- Familiar SQL interface
- ACID compliance
- Easy integration with existing applications
- Built-in JSON validation

- [The Growing Pains](#the-growing-pains)
- [What We'll Explore](#what-we'll-explore)
- [Hands-On Workshop](#hands-on-workshop)
- [ðŸ“š AWS Database Service References](#ðŸ“š-aws-database-service-references)

## The Growing Pains
However, as applications scale and data volumes grow, several challenges emerge:
- Complex query patterns become difficult to optimize
- JSON indexing limitations impact performance
- Large JSON documents affect storage efficiency
- Increased CPU usage for JSON parsing
- Query execution times become unpredictable

## What We'll Explore
In this module, we'll:
1. Demonstrate these challenges through practical examples
2. Create a PostgreSQL table with JSON data
3. Run various queries to highlight performance bottlenecks
4. Analyze query execution plans and performance metrics
5. Set the stage for migration to purpose-built databases

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Confused about which database to choose? The [Purpose-Built Databases Workshop](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/learn/) provides a decision framework used by AWS architects. You\'ll learn to match workload characteristics to optimal database engines, avoiding costly architectural mistakes.

## Hands-On Workshop
Ready to see these challenges in action? Proceed to [JSON in PostgreSQL Example](./json-in-pg-example.ipynb) where we'll:
- Create and populate a sample table with JSON data
- Execute increasingly complex queries
- Observe performance implications
- Identify scaling limitations

This will help you understand why and when to consider purpose-built databases for your JSON workloads, which we'll cover in subsequent modules.
