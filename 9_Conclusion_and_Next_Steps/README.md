<strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Cost Management Alert</strong><br>
Before proceeding with next steps, remember to clean up the AWS resources you created during this cookbook to avoid unexpected charges. Some resources like Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS clusters, and AWS NAT Gateways incur ongoing costs even when not actively used.

### Resource Cleanup Checklist

**AWS CloudFormation Stacks** (Recommended approach)
- Delete all AWS CloudFormation stacks created during the cookbook
- This automatically removes associated resources
- Monitor the deletion process to ensure completion

**Manual Cleanup** (If needed)
- **Amazon EC2 Instances** - Stop and terminate test instances
- **Amazon RDS/Aurora Clusters** - Delete database clusters and snapshots
- **Amazon S3 Buckets** - Empty and delete buckets (be careful with data)
- **AWS Lambda Functions** - Delete unused functions
- **AWS API Gateway** - Remove test APIs
- **Amazon Cognito User Pools** - Delete test user pools
- **AWS Amplify Apps** - Delete test applications

**Cost Monitoring**
- Check [AWS Billing Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/) for any unexpected charges
- Set up [AWS Budgets](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/) for future projects
- Review [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) for usage patterns
