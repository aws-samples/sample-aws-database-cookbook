# AWS Database Cookbook

Welcome to the AWS Database Cookbook! By the end of this guide, you'll take away working applications and the knowledge needed to build your own solutions on AWS. You'll gain hands-on experience with essential AWS services, including AWS infrastructure fundamentals, networking fundamentals, serverless architectures, database management, and Generative AI implementations.

- [What You'll Achieve](#what-you'll-achieve)
- [Who Should Read This Cookbook](#who-should-read-this-cookbook)
- [The Ways You Can Use This Cookbook](#the-ways-you-can-use-this-cookbook)

## Why This Cookbook?

While AWS offers powerful services and solutions, getting started can feel overwhelming. That's why we've created this practical, hands-on guide that:

- Provides working applications you can deploy immediately using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates
- Builds core concepts through real applications you can take away and modify
- Builds your knowledge progressively from fundamentals to advanced topics

**Tenets of the cookbook:**

1. **AWS journey alignment**: Follows the customer's experience with AWS, from building MVPs and PoCs to scalability and performance tuning, incorporating purpose-built databases and services tailored to startup growth stages. Includes integrated troubleshooting guides and common pitfall warnings to streamline the development experience.
2. **End-to-end solution focus**: Demonstrates complete solutions that span from database design to application architecture, API integration, and modern GenAI services, enhancing your knowledge of how these elements work together cohesively in real-world scenarios.
3. **Vertical-specific guidance**: Presents explicit industry-specific architectural examples and implementations.
4. **Opinionated best practices**: Provides clear recommendations rather than overwhelming users with all possible options. Simplifies complex concepts with clear, jargon-free explanations, focusing on just sufficient knowledge needed for implementation.
5. **Integrated cost management**: Emphasizes cost estimation and optimization throughout the process, including interactive tools and tips.
6. **Practical, hands-on approach**: Focuses on actionable steps and real-world scenarios rather than theoretical concepts. Provides pre-built templates and scripts in Jupyter Notebooks to reduce setup time and enhance learning.

## The Ways You Can Use This Cookbook

This cookbook is designed to cater to various learning preferences and experience levels, offering flexibility in how you approach AWS learning and implementation. Whether you're building your first AWS application or optimizing existing infrastructure, you'll find the guidance you need to succeed.

### Learning by Doing

Dive straight into building working applications:

1. **Serverless Retail Web Application**: Deploy a fully functional e-commerce application using AWS Amplify, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, Amazon Aurora DSQL, and Amazon S3.
   - [A single region deployment powered by highly performant and scalable Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL](./3_Building_Your_First_Serverless_Web_App_with_Aurora/README.MD)
   - [A multi-region active-active deployment powered by a serverless distributed SQL database Amazon Aurora DSQL](./5_Scaling_for_Success_Growing_with_Aurora/5.3_Vertical_and_Horizontal_Scaling_Strategies/5.3.2_Create_Aurora-DSQL.ipynb)

2. **[Life Insurance Agent Powered by GenAI](./8_Building_Your_First_GenAI_Application_with_AWS_Data_Foundations/8.3_Building_Your_Life_Insurance_Agent/README.md)**: Build an AI-powered system that manages life insurance policies, processes premium payments, and provides policy information using generative AI. This solution leverages Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base, Amazon Bedrock Agent, Anthropic Claude models, Aurora PostgreSQL, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3.

3. **[Healthcare database system natural language search](./8_Building_Your_First_GenAI_Application_with_AWS_Data_Foundations/8.4_Healthcare_Database_System_Natural_Language_Search/README.md)**: Implement an application that enables users to interact with healthcare databases using natural language. You will implement a natural language to SQL conversion using large language models and translate users' questions into clear actionable insights.

The application includes:

- Ready-to-deploy CloudFormation templates for quick setup and experimentation.
- Detailed architecture diagrams and explanations.
